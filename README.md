# Project developed for Bootcamp Driven Education

## Instagram static page layout with html and css.

#### Requirements for the project:

- Layout
     - [ ] Apply layout to *desktop*, following layout provided in Figma;
     - [ ] Apply layout to *mobile*, following layout provided in Figma;
     - [ ] The layout without *sidebar* must be activated when the screen width is less than 935px;
     - [ ] The layout for *mobil*e must be activated when the screen width is less than 614px;
     - [ ] It is not mandatory that the *sidebar* is fixed as the user scrolls down the page as it happens on Instagram (but it is a bonus).
- Icons
     - [ ] Use the icons from the library [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/);
    
     ðŸ’¡The **Tips** section contains a tutorial for using the library.
    
- Stories
     - [ ] In the *stories* box, there must be enough items to exceed the width, but the extra items must not be displayed, according to *layout*.
     - [ ] There should be, in *desktop* mode, a little arrow in the right corner of *stories* (as shown in the Figma layout).
     - [ ] The little arrow does not need to work when clicked (it will only be possible when we see JavaScript).
     - [ ] There cannot be a visible horizontal *scroll*.
